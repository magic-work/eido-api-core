# Service Layer (a.k.a. Application Layer)
#
# This folder houses the service layer, where business logic resides.
# We inject dependencies from the repository/data access layer, (which
# is in models/).
#
# In this layer, you'll find classes and functions that encapsulate
# the core business logic of our application. These classes serve as
# intermediaries between the presentation layer (e.g., views or controllers)
# and the data access layer (models/repositories).
#
# The primary responsibilities of the Service Layer include:
# - Implementing use cases and business operations.
# - Orchestrating actions based on user requests.
# - Enforcing business rules and data validation.
# - Handling errors and exceptions related to business logic.
#
# To achieve a clean separation of concerns and maintain loose coupling,
# we employ dependency injection. Service classes are designed to accept
# instances of repository classes as constructor arguments or method parameters.
# This allows us to easily switch between different data storage technologies
# and facilitates unit testing by using mock repositories.
#
# When defining functions or methods in this layer, consider adhering to the
# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) to ensure that each function has a clear
# and focused purpose. Additionally, make use of proper error handling mechanisms
# to provide meaningful feedback to the presentation layer and maintain the
# integrity of the application's data.
